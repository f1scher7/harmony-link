# HarmonyLink (https://harmonylink.site)

HarmonyLink is an interactive web application that uses advanced filters such as interests, field of study, relationship status, city, age, and gender to connect users with their ideal conversation partners in video chats.

## Notice of Service Interruption
The AWS free trial period has ended, and as a result, the site is temporarily offline. I'm working on restoring service as soon as possible.
